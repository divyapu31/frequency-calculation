# frequency-calculation and description of the graphs
Find the resonant frequencies for lower and upper frequency bands.
Design a full mode cavity, and divide in four Quarter-mode cavities along two magnetic walls to design dual frequency band MIMO antenna. The lower frequency 5 GHz and upper operating frequency 5.8 GHz can be calulated with PYTHON codes "S-parameters calculation.py".
CST Micorowave Studio solver is used for optimization and analysis. 
Define the dimensions as width of the cavities, diameter and pitch of the vias.
define the frequency range 4 GHz to 7 GHz
Calculate S-parameters (S11, S22, S12, S13, S14, S23, S24) for 4-port MIMO antenna and plot the graphs
perform parameteric analysis by changing the parameters slot length (ls), slot position (k1/k2), gap (g) etc. and reproduce the figures Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7
